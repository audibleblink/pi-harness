Create an execution plan, based on a PRD, and save it out to a file: ./plan.md

## The PRD

@prd.md


## Guidelines

- Create and save the execution plan as a file: ./plan.md
- The entire plan should have multiple phases
- Be sure to plan in phases, where each leaves a complete, fully functioning, and tested component of code
- Each phase must be a top-level `## Phase N: <name>` heading
- Each phase must declare its dependencies on a single line directly under its heading, in the form `**Depends on:** Phase 2, Phase 3` (or `**Depends on:** none`). This is parsed by `sdd-apply` to build the execution DAG.
- Into each phase, implement a way to check your work so that you know you are done.
  - This could be software testing, computer-use tools, external bash scripts, etc
  - This must be an autonomous feedback loop
- Each phase should have a checklist of tasks

## Plan Review Loop

After completing each chunk of the plan:

1. Dispatch plan-document-reviewer subagent with precisely crafted review context — never your session history. This keeps the reviewer focused on the plan, not your thought process.
   - Provide: chunk content, path to spec document
2. If ❌ Issues Found:
   - Fix the issues in the chunk
   - Re-dispatch reviewer for that chunk
   - Repeat until ✅ Approved
3. If ✅ Approved: proceed to next chunk (or execution handoff if last chunk)

**Chunk boundaries:** Use `## Chunk N: <name>` headings to delimit chunks. Each chunk should be ≤1000 lines and logically self-contained.

**Review loop guidance:**
- Same agent that wrote the plan fixes it (preserves context)
- If loop exceeds 5 iterations, surface to human for guidance
- Reviewers are advisory - explain disagreements if you believe feedback is incorrect


# Plan Document Reviewer Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching a plan document reviewer subagent.

**Purpose:** Verify the plan chunk is complete, matches the spec, and has proper task decomposition.

**Dispatch after:** Each plan chunk is written

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Review plan chunk N"
  prompt: |
    You are a plan document reviewer. Verify this plan chunk is complete and ready for implementation.

    **Plan chunk to review:** [PLAN_FILE_PATH] - Chunk N only
    **Spec for reference:** [SPEC_FILE_PATH]

    ## What to Check

    | Category | What to Look For |
    |----------|------------------|
    | Completeness | TODOs, placeholders, incomplete tasks, missing steps |
    | Spec Alignment | Chunk covers relevant spec requirements, no scope creep |
    | Task Decomposition | Tasks atomic, clear boundaries, steps actionable |
    | File Structure | Files have clear single responsibilities, split by responsibility not layer |
    | File Size | Would any new or modified file likely grow large enough to be hard to reason about as a whole? |
    | Task Syntax | Checkbox syntax (`- [ ]`) on steps for tracking |
    | Chunk Size | Each chunk under 1000 lines |

    ## CRITICAL

    Look especially hard for:
    - Any TODO markers or placeholder text
    - Steps that say "similar to X" without actual content
    - Incomplete task definitions
    - Missing verification steps or expected outputs
    - Files planned to hold multiple responsibilities or likely to grow unwieldy

    ## Output Format

    ## Plan Review - Chunk N

    **Status:** Approved | Issues Found

    **Issues (if any):**
    - [Task X, Step Y]: [specific issue] - [why it matters]

    **Recommendations (advisory):**
    - [suggestions that don't block approval]
```

**Reviewer returns:** Status, Issues (if any), Recommendations
